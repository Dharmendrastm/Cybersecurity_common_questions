# What is pentesting and types of pentesting
Penetration testing is also knwon as pen testing or ethical hacking. It describe the intentional launching of simulated cyberattacks that seek out exploitable vulnerabilities in computer systems, networks, websites, and applications.

The type of penetraion testing noramlly depends on the scope and the organizational wants and requirements. 

# This can classified into 3 types.

**BLACK BOX PENETRATION TESTING**

In this black box penetration testing, tester has no idea about the systems that he is going to test . He is intrested to gather information about the target network or systems.

**WHITE BOX PENETRATION TESTING**

In this white box penetration testing, it is noramlly considered as a simulationn of an attack by an internal source. It is also known as structural, glass box, and open box testing.

White box Penetration testing examines the code coverage and does data flow testing, path testing, loop testing, etc.

**GREY BOX PENETRATION TEESTING**

In this grey box testing a tester usually provides partial or limited information about the internal details of the program of a system.

# DNS Working 
| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 1. Initial Query | When searching for www.example.com the browser and OS first check their local cache for the  corresponding IP address |
| 2. Cache miss | If no record is found, the OS queries the "Resolving Name  server " (RNS) For the IP addres. The RNS checks its own cache |
| 3. Root Name Servers | If the RNS does not have the record, it queries the Root name server, which provide addresses of the TLD Name Server for .com |
| 4. TLD Nmae Server | The RNS queries the .com TLD name server, which provide the address of the Authoritative Nmae Server for example.com |
| 5. Authorative Name Server | The Authorative Nmae Server for example.com provide the IP address of www.example.com. The RNS cahches this result and returns it to the OS |


---
# SSH handshake Process

| Step | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| 1. Clients initiates | The SSH clients initiates a connectiosn to the SSH server by sending a connection request |
| 2. Server  respond | The SSH server responds with its public key and a set of supported algorithm |
| 3. Key Exchange | The client and server exchange cryptographic keys to agree on ashared secret for encryption |
| 4. Authentication | the clients sends an authentication request (username and password, or key-based authentication) |
| 5. server verifies | the server verifies the clients credentials. if valid, it send an acknowledgement |
| 6. Secure Connection | Once authentication is sucessful, both the clients and server establish an encrypted session |

# What is cross-site scripting?

Attacker inject malicious script into trusted websites, which then execute in the victim's browser potenially leading to session hijackiing or data theft.

1. **Reflected XSS** – Malicious script is injected into a request (e.g., URL) and reflected in the response. It is not stored on the server.  
2. **Stored XSS** – The script is permanently stored on the server (e.g., in a database) and executed when users visit the affected page.  
3. **DOM (Document Object Model) -Based XSS** – The attack manipulates the page’s DOM using JavaScript without involving the server, executing malicious code dynamically in the browser.  

---
# What is SQl Injection ?

Attacker insert malicious sql code into a web application database query allowing them maipulate or gain unauthrised access to the database.

1. **Boolean-Based SQLi** – Exploits conditional responses (true/false) to infer database information.  
2. **Time-Based SQLi** – Uses delays (e.g., `SLEEP()` function) to determine if a query is vulnerable.  
3. **Error-Based SQLi** – Extracts data by triggering database error messages.  
4. **Union-Based SQLi** – Uses `UNION` statements to fetch additional data from different tables.  
5. **Blind SQLi** – The attacker receives no direct feedback but determines information through indirect observations.  
6. **Out-of-Band SQLi** – Uses external channels (e.g., DNS or HTTP requests) to exfiltrate data.
